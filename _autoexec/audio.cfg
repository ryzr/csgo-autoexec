windows_speaker_config          "1"     // "-1" Default (2 Speakers) | "1" Headphones | "3" Four speakers | "4" Two speakers | "6" 5.1 Surround
dsp_enhance_stereo              "1"     // If set to 1 enhances the stereo effect, making sound richer and more atmospheric for a slight performance hit. turn this to 0 if you use anything but a stereo headphone.
snd_headphone_pan_exponent      "1.2"   // Relative volume of middle sound versus side sound. "1.0" means that sounds in the middle of your screen and sounds on the sides will be the same volume. While this gives the most accurate perception of sound distance regardless of which way you are facing, far away noises can be much more difficult to hear or locate.
snd_headphone_pan_radial_weight "1.0"   // Affects how the left-right volumes change. "0.0" is a linear change, while increasing this value makes the change more sigmoidal. "0.0" gives the most accurate left-right positioning of sounds, but again means that facing towards a sound won't help you pinpoint its location. Overall, this means that these settings have superior stereo accuracy for getting a general idea of a sound's source, but poor precision for narrowing down the exact location.
snd_front_headphone_position    "90.0"  // The size of the cone for hearing sounds that are in front of you
snd_rear_headphone_position     "90.0"  // The size of the cone for hearing sounds that are behind you
